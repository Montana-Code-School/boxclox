The throttled function comes with a `cancel`\n\t * method to cancel delayed invocations. Provide an options object to indicate\n\t * that `func` should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the\n\t * `wait` timeout. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n\t * result of the last `func` call.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n\t * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the the throttled function is\n\t * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t *\n\t * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)\n\t * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n\t * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n\t * @param {Object} [options] The options object.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true] Specify invoking on the leading\n\t *  edge of the timeout.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true] Specify invoking on the trailing\n\t *  edge of the timeout.\n\t * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * // avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling\n\t * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n\t *\n\t * // invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes\n\t * jQuery('.interactive').on('click', _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, {\n\t *   'trailing': false\n\t * }));\n\t *\n\t * // cancel a trailing throttled call\n\t * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n\t */\n\tfunction throttle(func, wait, options) {\n\t  var leading = true,\n\t      trailing = true;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t  }\n\t  if (options === false) {\n\t    leading = false;\n\t  } else if (isObject(options)) {\n\t    leading = 'leading' in options ?
